## Documentation ##
This Documentation is build by a project specific macro-html filetype (with the extension '.ahtml'), 
which allows certain macros that are unfolded by the haskell tool in 'generator/'.

Usually you should not have to build the documentation since i try to push the already build html files,
if you for some reason have to build, just install 'ghc' and run the Makefile.
