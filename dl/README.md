# Flint DL #
Implementation of often used deep learning algorithm and concepts.
Still a work in progress with no first official version.

## Models ##
## Layers ##
## Losses ##
## Optimizers ##

---
## Building ##
With cmake:
```
mkdir build;
cd build;
cmake ..;
make;
```
You need to have Flint and OpenCL installed (`make install` in Flints build folder).
